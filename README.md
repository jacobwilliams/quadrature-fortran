### Brief description

An object-oriented modern Fortran library to integrate functions using adaptive Gaussian quadrature. There are five selectable methods to use:

 * Adaptive 6-point Legendre-Gauss
 * Adaptive 8-point Legendre-Gauss
 * Adaptive 10-point Legendre-Gauss
 * Adaptive 12-point Legendre-Gauss
 * Adaptive 14-point Legendre-Gauss

The library supports:

1D integration:
   $$\int_{x_l}^{x_u} f(x) dx$$
2D integration:
   $$\int_{y_l}^{y_u} \int_{x_l}^{x_u} f(x,y) dx dy$$
3D integration:
   $$\int_{z_l}^{z_u} \int_{y_l}^{y_u} \int_{x_l} ^{x_u} f(x,y,z) dx dy dz$$
4D integration:
   $$\int_{q_l}^{q_u} \int_{z_l}^{z_u} \int_{y_l} ^{y_u} \int_{x_l}^{x_u} f(x,y,z,q) dx dy dz  dq$$
5D integration:
   $$\int_{r_l}^{r_u} \int_{q_l}^{q_u} \int_{z_l} ^{z_u} \int_{y_l}^{y_u} \int_{x_l}^{x_u} f(x, y,z,q,r) dx dy dz dq dr$$
6D integration:
   $$\int_{s_l}^{s_u} \int_{r_l}^{r_u} \int_{q_l} ^{q_u} \int_{z_l}^{z_u} \int_{y_l}^{y_u} \int_ {x_l}^{x_u} f(x,y,z,q,r,s) dx dy dz dq dr ds$$

The core code is based on the SLATEC routine [DGAUS8](http://www.netlib.org/slatec/src/dgaus8.f) (which is the source of the 8-point routine). Coefficients for the others were obtained from [here](http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/bezierinfo/legendre-gauss-values.php). The original 1D code has been generalized for multi-dimensional integration.

### Compiling

A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) manifest file is included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```

To use `quadrature-fortran` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
quadrature-fortran = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/quadrature-fortran.git" }
```

### Documentation

The API documentation for the current ```master``` branch can be found [here](https://jacobwilliams.github.io/quadrature-fortran/).  This is generated by processing the source files with [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford).
